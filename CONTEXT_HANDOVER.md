# STL Viewer App - Context Handover

## Project Overview
Minimalist web app to display 3D STL files with interactive controls, deployed on Render.

## Current Status
✅ **FULLY DEPLOYED AND WORKING** at https://stl-viewer-app.onrender.com
- Displays user's 153MB STL file (Example.stl) 
- Bone/ivory colored model with realistic lighting
- Minimal UI with glass-morphism controls
- Full rotation and zoom controls

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/JS with Three.js for 3D rendering
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server that proxies STL files to avoid CORS
- **Hosting**: Render (using starter plan)
- **STL Storage**: GitHub Release (v1.0) - file too large for regular repo

## Key Files
```
/Users/samuel/stl-viewer-app/
├── index.html          # Main UI with Three.js viewer
├── server.js          # Express server with STL proxy/caching
├── package.json       # Dependencies (just express)
└── model.stl          # Local STL file (gitignored)
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### 1. STL File Handling
- Original file: `/Users/samuel/Downloads/Example.stl` (153MB)
- Hosted at: GitHub Release v1.0 (created with `gh release create`)
- Server proxies from GitHub to avoid CORS issues
- Caches in memory after first load

### 2. UI Features
- **Bone color model**: #f5f5dc
- **Light slider**: Controls both intensity AND direction (rotates around model)
- **Rotation ball**: Drag to spin model, visual indicator shows movement
- **Glass-morphism controls**: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur

### 3. Deployment Details
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/nekonomicus/stl-viewer-app
- **Render**: Deployed via API with key `rnd_g6ZtLQ3NdKuNaQGH3LvQzxFkkyKi`
- **Owner ID**: tea-csp8t4rgbbvc73cerssg
- Auto-deploys on push to master branch

## Known Issues Resolved
1. ✅ CORS blocking direct GitHub Release access - Fixed with server proxy
2. ✅ Git LFS doesn't work on Render free tier - Using GitHub Release instead
3. ✅ Rotation ball had no visual feedback - Added moving indicator
4. ✅ Light only changed intensity - Now rotates around model

## To Continue Development

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/samuel/stl-viewer-app
npm install
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploy Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
# Render auto-deploys
```

### If Context Gets Too Long
Start new conversation with:
"Continue working on the STL viewer app at /Users/samuel/stl-viewer-app. It's a minimalist 3D viewer deployed at https://stl-viewer-app.onrender.com. The app displays STL files with bone color, has lighting and rotation controls. Check CONTEXT_HANDOVER.md for full details."

### Adding New Features
Current architecture supports:
- Multiple STL files (modify server.js routes)
- Color picker (add to controls div)
- Model info display (file size, vertices)
- Animation presets (auto-rotation patterns)
- Screenshot functionality

### Important Commands
```bash
# View GitHub release with STL
gh release view v1.0 --repo nekonomicus/stl-viewer-app

# Update STL file in release
gh release upload v1.0 /path/to/new.stl --repo nekonomicus/stl-viewer-app --clobber

# Check Render deployment
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer rnd_g6ZtLQ3NdKuNaQGH3LvQzxFkkyKi" \
  https://api.render.com/v1/services/srv-d3aho4ggjchc73cmo3c0
```

## User Requirements History
1. "Ultra minimalist website with minimal UX"
2. "Just to display a spinnable version of the STL"
3. "Hands free deployment"
4. "Model hosted only, viewable by anyone"
5. "Render the model in bone color"
6. "UI for lighting adjustment and turning via a ball"
7. "Usable, minimal, beautiful"

## Final State
The app successfully loads and displays the user's 153MB STL file with all requested features working properly. The deployment is complete and accessible to anyone on the internet.
